# Neovim Configuration

Based on kickstart.nvim with modular organisation. Three-way split: `core/` =
editor settings + fundamental behaviour with no plugin coupling; `features/` =
self-contained bespoke features (each owns its keymaps via `setup()`);
`plugins/` = thin lazy specs that `require('custom.features.X')`. Only
`lua/kickstart/plugins/` (lint.lua, indent_line.lua) tracks upstream
kickstart; the debug, neo-tree and gitsigns specs diverge from it and live in
`custom/plugins/`.

`core/keymaps.lua` is a slim entry point: it defines a few fundamental
editing tweaks (`<Esc>` hl-clear, `<leader>v`/`<leader>V` paste-last-yank,
smart `i`/`a`, `<leader>i` insert-space, `m`/`M`/`gm` line nav, `gx`, terminal
escape, `<leader>by`/`<leader>e`/`<leader>g`/`<leader>u`)
and then calls `setup()` on the focused modules: core (folding, windows,
macos-nav, refresh, spellcheck) and features (lists, diag-scan, build,
binary-view, go, snippets).
Each focused module owns its own keymaps; add new ones where they belong
rather than letting `keymaps.lua` regrow into a grab-bag.

## lua_ls Workspace Config (`.luarc.json`)

`.luarc.json` at the repo root is the authoritative config for lua-language-server — it
overrides anything set via `vim.lsp.config` in lua. It sets `runtime.version` (LuaJIT) and
disables noisy diagnostic categories.

Type libraries (the neovim runtime plus plugin types like `Snacks` and `Mini*`) are **not**
listed here — they are supplied on demand by `lazydev.nvim`
(`lua/custom/plugins/lazydev.lua`), which loads each plugin's annotations when its trigger
word appears in a lua buffer, giving `K` hover and completion for those globals. This is
why `.luarc.json` must **not** declare `workspace.library`: lua_ls treats `.luarc.json` as
authoritative, so a static `workspace.library` would override the libraries lazydev pushes
through the client (lazydev's own README recommends disabling it when a `.luarc.json` with
a library is present). The damage reaches past hover: in any project whose `.luarc.json`
declares `workspace.library`, lua_ls stops resolving that project's own `require`d modules,
so `gd` on a cross-file symbol reports "No definitions found" while same-file lookups still
work. Any entry triggers it, including a lone `${3rd}` one. To add hover for another plugin,
add a `{ path = '<plugin>', words = { '<Global>' } }` entry in `lazydev.lua` — not a library
path here; third-party libraries (`${3rd}/busted`, `${3rd}/luassert`) go there for the same
reason. `words` are lua patterns matched with `line:find` and no plain flag, so a trigger has to
be specific enough not to match inside ordinary identifiers. Partial plugin-opts tables that trip `missing-fields` (e.g. `Snacks.dashboard.open`)
get an inline `---@diagnostic disable-next-line: missing-fields` at the call site rather
than a blanket disable, so the check still catches real omissions elsewhere.

The file is **gitignored** and installed from `.luarc.json.template` during
`dotfiles install` / `dotfiles update` by `scripts/install/create-symlinks.sh` (a plain
copy with no machine-specific path to substitute). To change the workspace
config, edit the template; the active file is refreshed on the next install run.

## Linting

```bash
luacheck nvim/lua/ --config nvim/.luacheckrc
```
