## Quick Start

Prerequisites: macOS or Linux. On a fresh macOS, run `xcode-select --install` first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/undont/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh            # full install (default)
```

### Install presets

| Preset      | Components                                        | Use case                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--minimal` | zsh, tmux                                         | servers, remote machines, SSH     |
| `--core`    | + nvim, ghostty, AI/CLI tools, launchers          | Linux desktop, cross-platform dev |
| `--full`    | + Hammerspoon, Karabiner, Raycast, music-presence | macOS power user (default)        |

The installer backs up existing configs, installs Homebrew packages filtered by preset, creates symlinks, sets up plugin managers, and runs a health check. Your preset is saved so `dotfiles update` remembers it.

<details>
<summary><b>All installation options</b></summary>

```bash
./install.sh              # full installation (default)
./install.sh --minimal    # lightweight server setup
./install.sh --core       # cross-platform dev setup
./install.sh --full       # everything including macOS apps
./install.sh --skip-brew  # skip Homebrew/package installation
./install.sh --skip-backup # skip backing up existing configs
./install.sh --check-only  # only run prerequisite and health checks
```

</details>

---

## How it works

The setup is layered: a shared base lives in this repo and gets symlinked into place, and tools that support it (tmux, ghostty, nvim, lazygit, gh-dash, hammerspoon) load a `local.*` file on top that `dotfiles update` never touches. Clone the repo, keep your tweaks in the local files, and run `dotfiles update` to pull upstream changes; your overrides survive. Fork it if you really want to make it your own or take the base in a different direction.

Version-gated scripts in [`scripts/migrations/`](scripts/migrations) run automatically during `dotfiles update` to handle changes the normal installer can't (converting a symlink to a user-owned copy, removing a deprecated package, fixing a config that drifted). They're idempotent and only run once per version range.

Built around staying on the keyboard: `` ` `` as the tmux prefix, fzf pickers everywhere, vim motions under space as `<leader>` in nvim, and zsh aliases for anything frequent enough to warrant one. Used daily across personal and work machines on macOS and Linux.

## Features

### Ghostty

> The terminal that powers everything.

Configured as a clean input layer rather than a productivity surface: keybind remappings emit consistent escape sequences across macOS and Linux (via a `{{PLATFORM_MOD}}` template), so the same tmux and nvim keybinds work identically on both platforms. Shell integration is enabled, the colour scheme follows the active dotfiles theme, and `~/.config/ghostty/local` is loaded at the end of the config so cursor style, fonts, and personal tweaks survive updates.

### Neovim

> Modular config based on kickstart.nvim with lazy.nvim, Treesitter, and Mason-managed language servers. Startup is roughly 100ms.

- **LSP** for TypeScript, Go, Python, Lua, C#/.NET (Roslyn), C/C++/Objective-C (clangd), Swift (sourcekit-lsp), ESLint, Bash, CSS/Tailwind, HTML, YAML and more, with formatting (clang-format, swift-format), linting (swiftlint), and codelldb debugging wired up for the C family and Swift
- **SonarLint** as a second LSP client surfacing SonarQube/SonarCloud diagnostics for JS/TS, Python, Go, C/C++, PHP, HTML/CSS, IaC (Terraform/HCL), Docker, YAML, and XML (no local C# analysis: its bundled omnisharp would fight the Roslyn setup, see [docs/SONARLINT.md](docs/SONARLINT.md)); connected mode auto-enables when `SONARQUBE_TOKEN` and `SONARQUBE_ORG` are set, with per-project binding via `.sonarlint/connectedMode.json` and ESLint-style rule overrides via `.sonarlint/localRules.json`, which you can edit by hand or populate from the `gra` code-action menu ("silence rule project-wide" / "in test files"); the first code action opens a rich rule-description popup that, for deprecation findings, leads with the deprecated symbol and its recommended replacement (see [docs/SONARLINT.md](docs/SONARLINT.md))
- **Diffs and PR review** via differ.nvim (my own plugin): local side-by-side diffs, file history, staging, GitHub PR review, merge conflict resolution, and diff-by-ticket (`<leader>dT`) through one renderer, with `<leader>d*` diff launchers and `<leader>p*` PR launchers (thread actions are in-diff gestures: `ga` comment, `gp` reply, `gr` resolve); Octo.nvim stays installed as a `:Octo` fallback, and gitsigns handles inline hunk decorations
- **The tpope suite:** fugitive (git wrapper), rhubarb (GitHub adapter for fugitive), abolish (case-aware substitution and coercion), repeat (extend `.` to plugin maps), and sleuth (auto-detect indent settings)
- **Build picker** (`Space q`) auto-detects Go, TypeScript, .NET, and Makefile projects and runs the appropriate build into the quickfix list
- **Tests** via Neotest (Go, Vitest/Bun, Jest/React Native, and pytest adapters), with .NET handled separately by easy-dotnet's dedicated test runner (`<leader>te` opens its Test Explorer)
- **Go editing helpers**: gomodifytags-backed struct tag add/clear (`<leader>la`/`<leader>lc`) and iferr block generation (`<leader>le`), plus `:GoAddTags`/`:GoRmTags`/`:GoIfErr`; both tools are Mason-managed
- **Binary object viewer**: opening a `.o`, `.a`, `.dylib`, or `.so` renders a decoded read-only view (demangled symbols, disassembly, hex dump) instead of raw bytes, with `s`/`d`/`x` to switch between them
- **Custom dashboard** plus a searchable cheatsheet (`Space ?`) for the keybindings
- **Self-contained colourschemes** with no plugin dependencies, so generated themes drop in as plain Lua files
- **GitHub Copilot** configured to refuse `.env`, credentials, and other secret files
- `~/.config/nvim/local.lua` is loaded before plugin specs (so `vim.g.*` is visible to them) and survives updates

### Tmux

> `` ` `` as the prefix, vim-style navigation between panes and windows, and a help popup (`` ` h ``) if you forget anything.

- **Session save and restore** with tmux-resurrect + continuum, plus a custom extension that splits the combined save into per-session backups, so you can restore one session without bringing back everything else (and sessions survive reboots)
- **fzf pickers everywhere:** sessions (`` ` s ``), windows (`` ` f ``), running nvim instances, AI agent instances (Claude / OpenCode / Copilot / Codex), themes (`` ` t ``), and URLs from scrollback (`` ` u ``); popups auto-size between compact and full-screen depending on terminal width
- **Multi-agent alerts** show coloured indicators in the session list when Claude, OpenCode, Copilot, or Codex need attention, clearing automatically when you switch to the session; all four CLIs are wired in via dedicated hooks under `scripts/hooks/wrappers/` (each CLI needs its hooks set up; see [docs/AGENT-HOOKS.md](docs/AGENT-HOOKS.md))
- **Live agent state in the Claude switcher** (`` ` c ``): each instance shows what it's doing (● working, ◐ waiting for input, ○ idle, ✗ errored, ⚠ stuck) and, once it's waiting on you, how long it's been idle or blocked, driven by Claude Code hooks writing per-pane state files; stuck detection cross-checks the pane title so long tool runs aren't flagged (see [docs/AGENT-HOOKS.md](docs/AGENT-HOOKS.md))
- **Command exit alerts** flag the result with ✓ or ✗ when a long-running command finishes in a pane you've switched away from
- **Process list** (`` ` `` <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) is one fzf switcher over everything you're watching: running commands (tests, builds, servers) as live ● rows with elapsed time, plus finished commands as ✓/✗ rows; jump to any, press <kbd>x</kbd> to stop a running one or clear a finished one, or rerun a finished command with <kbd>r</kbd> (stage it on its window's prompt to review) or <kbd>R</kbd> (stage and run); finished rows also clear once you view their window
- **Undo system** (`Opt/Alt+u`) restores the most recently closed pane or window with full directory, scrollback, and layout intact
- **Session launchers** (`` ` p ``) cover `dev`, `github` (gh-dash), `btop`, `docker` (lazydocker), `dotfiles`, and `config`; an interactive wizard (`n`) scaffolds new ones, and user launchers in `~/.config/dotfiles/launchers/` override repo launchers by name
- **Navigation history** (`` ` - `` / `` ` = ``) for browser-style back/forward across windows and sessions
- `~/.config/tmux/local.conf` survives theme changes and updates

### Zsh

- **Powerlevel10k** prompt with instant prompt and git status
- **Performance:** lazy-loaded completions, fnm (~5ms) over nvm (~300ms), and cached eval for direnv and fzf, with median startup benchmarked in CI on every push and PR (the job fails if it exceeds 125ms)
- **carapace** as the completion bridge, so modern completion specs (gh, kubectl, docker, etc.) work in zsh without per-tool wrangling
- **zoxide** for a `cd` that learns the directories you actually use
- **fzf integration:** `Ctrl+R` for history search, `Ctrl+T` for file finding, and `Opt/Alt+A` for directory history
- **Git aliases** for the things you do all day: `gs` (status), `gl` (log), `gfp` (fetch + prune), `gpr` (prune local branches gone from remote), `grmc` (untrack files), and many more
- **Directory navigation:** `cdb`/`cdf` for browser-style back/forward, `mkcd` to make and enter, and `cl` for a full terminal reset
- **Editing:** `Ctrl+G` opens the current command in `$EDITOR`, and `Spacebar` expands the alias under the cursor
- **Tab completion** for the dotfiles CLI and the tmux helper commands; run `dot aliases` for the full list

### Dotfiles CLI

```bash
dotfiles update    # smart incremental update (only re-runs changed steps)
dotfiles status    # version, sync status, and local changes
dotfiles health    # full health check (symlinks, plugins, env vars)
dotfiles links     # show all managed symlinks and their status
dotfiles theme     # list, switch, or generate themes
dotfiles aliases   # browse all shell aliases and shortcuts
dotfiles notes     # browse the changelog in a pager
dotfiles version   # current version, release/update dates, preset, and theme
dotfiles edit      # open dotfiles in $EDITOR
```

`dot` is a shorthand for `dotfiles`. Both have full tab completion.

## Themes

> From within tmux, `` ` t `` opens an fzf picker over the hand-crafted set and Ghostty's themes; selecting one re-skins tmux, ghostty, neovim, fzf, gh-dash, and lazygit instantly with no restart. Selecting a Ghostty theme generates it on the fly.

The `dotfiles theme` CLI is the management surface, useful for scripting, listing, switching by name, and generating themes from a Ghostty palette:

```bash
dotfiles theme                                 # list available themes
dotfiles theme switch dracula                  # switch by name
dotfiles theme generate "Catppuccin Latte"     # generate a theme from a Ghostty palette
```

Two sources feed the picker:

- **14 hand-crafted themes** with tuned palettes, all checked against WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios: Dracula, Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo Night, Nord, Rosé Pine, Kanagawa, Gruvbox, Synthwave, One Dark, Monokai, Nightfox, Everforest, Ayu Dark, Solarized.
- **~460 Ghostty themes** generatable on the fly: the Lua pipeline parses a Ghostty palette (16 ANSI colours + foreground/background), derives semantic roles (six accents, selection, secondary surfaces), corrects for WCAG 2.1 (4.5:1 minimum contrast), and outputs a `.theme` file plus a self-contained neovim colourscheme

An AI CLI coding agent's statusline can follow the active theme too, for agents that render their statusline by running a script (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Antigravity CLI). Source `~/.config/dotfiles/statusline-theme.sh` to get `SL_*` ANSI colour variables mapped from the current palette, then use them behind your own defaults (e.g. `${SL_BRANCH:-…}`); semantic roles (the git `+/-` diff and status markers) are hue-locked so additions/deletions always read green/red whatever the theme. It reads the theme live, so the statusline re-colours on the next render after `dotfiles theme switch`. See [docs/THEME-SYSTEM.md](docs/THEME-SYSTEM.md#statusline-integration).

Themes are pure colour palettes; anything else you want to customise (fonts, cursor style, extra keybindings, per-machine settings) goes in the per-tool `local.*` files, which sit alongside the theme-generated configs and never get touched by `dotfiles update`:

| Tool        | Override file                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Tmux        | `~/.config/tmux/local.conf`       |
| Neovim      | `~/.config/nvim/local.lua`        |
| Ghostty     | `~/.config/ghostty/local`         |
| gh-dash     | `~/.config/gh-dash/local.yml`     |
| LazyGit     | `~/.config/lazygit/local.yml`     |
| Hammerspoon | `~/.hammerspoon/local.lua`        |
| Zsh         | `~/.zshrc` (your personal config) |

See [docs/THEME-SYSTEM.md](docs/THEME-SYSTEM.md) for the architecture.

### Tap trust

Homebrew is set to require explicit trust for non-official taps (`HOMEBREW_REQUIRE_TAP_TRUST=1`). The taps these tools come from are trusted automatically during install, and any taps you already had are trusted on update. To add a new third-party tap yourself, approve it once with `brew trust --tap <user/repo>` before installing from it.

### macOS-only (full preset)

- **Hammerspoon:** centres and resizes windows to 70% of the screen on creation for Ghostty, Arc, Dia, Discord, Slack, and Obsidian (skipping if already roughly centred); CLI access via the `hs` IPC binary, with a `~/.hammerspoon/local.lua` override
- **Karabiner Elements:** Caps Lock to Escape, Right Option to Control (for Ghostty + JetBrains keybind compatibility), UK keyboard layout fixes
- **Raycast:** Spotlight replacement
- **music-presence:** Discord Rich Presence for Apple Music

### Linux-only

- **keyd:** keyboard remapping daemon, the Linux equivalent of Karabiner, config at `keyd/default.conf`, deployed and enabled by `scripts/install/setup-keyd.sh`
