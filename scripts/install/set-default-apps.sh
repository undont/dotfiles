# set Zed as the default handler for code file types (macOS only)
#
# uses duti to bind file extensions to Zed. macOS quirks handled here:
#   - a stale LaunchServices registration makes duti's set a silent no-op
#     (the write succeeds but a competing app keeps winning), so Zed is
#     re-registered first
#   - extensions with no system-declared UTI resolve to an ephemeral dyn.*
#     type that LaunchServices refuses to bind (error -50), so they're
#     skipped. Zed already claims some of these (go, jsx) via its own
#     Info.plist, so they open in Zed regardless
#   - some extensions (log) are governed by a system UTI a built-in app
#     claims; binding the bare extension loses to that UTI, so the UTI is
#     bound instead (see bind_target)
#
# macOS 15+ shows a modal consent dialog on each programmatic handler change.
# to avoid re-nagging on every `dotfiles update`, an extension is only asked
# about once: it's skipped if Zed already handles it, or if the user declined
# before (recorded in .state/declined-default-apps). the dialog is modal so
# duti's set blocks until the click, letting a post-set re-check tell an
# accept from a decline
