# bundled theme files (its source of truth), but Ghostty isn't packaged on some
# Linux distros (e.g. Debian / Raspberry Pi OS), so those files are absent and
# generation fails. The theme resolver already searches
# ~/.local/share/ghostty/themes, so we populate that with the upstream Ghostty
# theme files (from mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes, which ships a ready-made
# ghostty/ directory) — no Ghostty binary required.
#
# On macOS the themes live inside Ghostty.app; where Ghostty is packaged
# (Arch/Fedora) /usr/share/ghostty/themes exists — both are skipped.
