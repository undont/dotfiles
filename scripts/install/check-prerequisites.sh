check-prerequisites.sh - Verify install bootstrap prerequisites

USAGE:
    ./scripts/install/check-prerequisites.sh

DESCRIPTION:
    Checks the two tools needed to bootstrap the install:
      • git  - to clone/update the repo
      • brew - to install everything in Brewfile

    Everything else (nvim, tmux, fzf, language toolchains, etc.) is
    installed by `brew bundle` during install.sh, so it's deliberately
    not checked here — gating on those would just produce false-MISSING
    noise on a fresh machine and duplicate what `brew bundle` will do
    moments later.

    Run health-check.sh after install if you want to verify the resulting
    toolchain.

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help   Show this help message

EXIT CODES:
    0 - git and brew are both present
    1 - one or both missing
