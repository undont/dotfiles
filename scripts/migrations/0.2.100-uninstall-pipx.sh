# Migration: replace pipx with uv.
#
# The Brewfile now ships `uv` instead of `pipx`. `uv tool install <name>`
# and `uvx <name>` are drop-in replacements for `pipx install` / `pipx run`,
# so the pipx formula and its managed venvs are no longer needed.
#
# We can't silently re-home pipx-managed apps under uv — uv keeps its own
# venv tree under `~/.local/share/uv/tools/` and the user may not want every
# pipx app reinstalled. Instead we list what was managed by pipx, snapshot
# it to disk so the user has a record, uninstall the apps + their venvs,
# then drop the pipx formula. Re-install anything you still want with
# `uv tool install <name>`.
