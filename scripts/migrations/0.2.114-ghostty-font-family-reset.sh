# migration: insert a `font-family = ""` reset into an existing ghostty local
# override when it sets a font-family but lacks the reset
#
# Ghostty chains repeated font-family values into a fallback list (first entry =
# primary) rather than last-value-wins. the base config (~/.config/ghostty/config)
# already sets font-family, so a bare `font-family = MyFont` in the user-owned
# local file ends up as a *fallback* behind the base font, not the primary. the
# fix is a leading `font-family = ""` that clears the inherited value first
#
# local.template now ships that reset for fresh installs, but local is
# copy-on-install (never overwritten), so existing users need it patched in here
#
# idempotent: does nothing if no font-family override is present, or if a reset
# already exists
